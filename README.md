# bank_term_deposits
The goal is to help the Portuguese retail bank find potential customers by predicting the telemarketing calls' success to sell these term deposits. This is done by analyzing information based on the collected historical bank dataÂ from May 2008 to Nov 2010.

This project aims to predict the customers who subscribe to the term deposit based on a sample dataset. The dataset consists of marketing campaign phone calls made for a Portuguese banking institution.
Objective of the project is to identify the profitable marketing metrics based on the provided customer data and thus help build a robust marketing strategy to maximize the profit.
The purpose of the project is to examine the performance and accuracy of multiple distinct algorithms to build models for classification.
